Efficiency
==========

Determine efficiency for high order applications.

Use Newton Cotes:

Constant Interpolant:
---------------------
This rule approximates the integral by using the midpoints of the integral itself. It does this by using a
rectangle at the midpoint of the integral and then dividing them up into smaller, easier approximating
rectangles to come to a close and more accurate approximation. The step sizes to test the approximation
accuracy is run through the equation itself:
\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx\approx \sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}f(x_{i})  




Gaussian Quadtratures, or other error approximation methods to determine convergence errors and best use cases for high order applications.
